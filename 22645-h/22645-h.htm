<h2>MIXED NOTIONS.</h2>

<p class='center larger'>No. VII.&mdash;PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE.</p>

<p class='center'>(<i>Scene and Persons as usual.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>to First Well-Informed Man</i>). I say, have you ever been in
the House of Commons?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>shortly</i>). No, you know I haven't.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Oh, I don't mean as a Member. Of course I know you wouldn't
stand the rot of all these Constituents, or whatever they call
themselves. But have you ever been there as a visitor while a debate's
going on?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Yes, once&mdash;some years ago. But why do you ask?</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>producing an order of admission</i>). Well, you see, I got old
<span class='smcap'>Jenkins</span> to give me a ticket for to-night, and I'm hanged if I know how
I'm to get there, or when I'm to go, or anything about it. I thought you
might be able to tell me how it's done.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Let's have a look at your ticket.</p>

<p class='ralign'>[<i>Both the</i> Well-Informed Men <i>inspect it with
an air of critical sagacity.</i></p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>after a prolonged pause</i>). I don't see where your
difficulty is. You just present this at the door.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Ah, I daresay!&mdash;but what door? That's what I want to know.
The place looks as if it had about fifty thousand doors, you know. And
then I believe, if you make any mistakes, they march you off, in
two-twos, as a dynamiter, or a Socialist, or an agitator, or something.
You know old <span class='smcap'>Bonker</span>. Well, he went there once with a black bag, in which
he'd got some sandwiches and cake, and, just because he wouldn't open
it, they made no end of a row, and shoved him in the Clock-tower, or
something, until he apologised. I don't want any of those games, you
know.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> Don't take a black bag then. They won't want to search
your pockets.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>relieved</i>). Won't they? That's one comfort, at any rate. Do
you think I ought to go in at the big entrance?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Of course you ought. The others are only for Members.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Ah! And I suppose I ought to get there pretty early now that
they've changed their hours. (<i>With determination.</i>) I'll go about
half-past eleven.</p>

<p class='ralign'>[<i>A pause. They read papers.</i></p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>suddenly, with intense alarm</i>). Oh, I say, look here, you
chaps. Here's old <span class='smcap'>Gladstone</span> gone and suspended the Twelve o'Clock Rule.
What does that mean?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> It means that they start everything at twelve o'clock
in the day.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> No, it doesn't. It means that they don't start anything
till twelve o'clock at night.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>pityingly</i>). My dear fellow, where have you been all
these years? They <i>always</i> go home on the stroke of midnight now.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> That's just where you're wrong. Midnight to two in the
morning is just jolly well their best time now.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> I'll bet you half a thick 'un you're wrong!</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> And I'll bet you half a thick 'un I'm right!</p>

<p class='ralign'>[<i>The argument continues for some minutes in this
strain.</i></p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> I wonder if they'll have any obstruction. I should like to
see some of that. I believe it's no end amusing.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Oh, you may trust this Opposition for that. Their only
notion for employing time is to obstruct everything and everybody.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>with a deadly calmness</i>). Ah! you call it
obstruction, of course, because you want to rush your iniquitous Bills
through the House. But you don't think we're going to stand that, do
you?&mdash;because we're not, and the Country's with us. Just look at
Grimsby.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> All right! Suppose you look at Cirencester.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> What do you say to Stockport then?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> And what do <i>you</i> say to Walsham and Hexall, and all
the rest of them? (<i>At the suggestion of the</i> Average Man, <i>they abandon
this fiery debate. A pause.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Who's Speaker now?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Sir <span class='smcap'>Robert Peel</span>.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Will he be there to-night?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Of course he will. He's got to be there.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> But then what does the Chairman of Committee do?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Oh, ah,&mdash;um, let me see; the Chairman of Committee
does&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Brightly.</i>) He's only appointed, you know, when they want a
Committee about something.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> I fancy he has to read the Bills.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>gathering assurance as he proceeds</i>). Not when
they're read a first time. Somebody else does that&mdash;I forget what they
call him. The Chairman reads 'em a second time, and takes 'em up to the
House of Lords.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> So he does, of course. I ought to have remembered that. But
I'd got a sort of notion they didn't really read the Bills at all&mdash;just
chucked 'em into a bag, and called it a Second Reading.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>condescendingly</i>). That's how they used to do it
about ten years ago; but they had to alter the whole thing after they
got <span class='smcap'>Bradlaugh</span> into the House.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Why was that?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Well, he wouldn't take an oath, you know; so, after
that, they altered everything.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>with admiration</i>). By Jove, what a chap you are for
recollecting things!</p>

<h2>QUEER QUERIES.</h2>

<p><span class='smcap'>A New Poll-Tax.</span>&mdash;Would somebody inform me of the easiest way of getting
into Parliament? I see that Members are soon going to be paid, and that
would be very useful to me, as my present yearly expenses are &pound;1,500,
and my income barely &pound;150. Had I better try as a "Labour Candidate"? I
feel that I may claim the title, on account of the labour&mdash;twelve hours
at least <i>per diem</i>&mdash;which I have to expend on getting out of the way of
my creditors. I presume that, before long, there will be Parliaments all
over the place, for England, Wales, and Scotland, as well as for
Ireland, and I want to get into <em>all</em>! At least, I want to get into all
where the excellent system of payment of Members is adopted, with
salaries "On the higher scale," as they say in the Courts. It is curious
that, when I explain to my creditors this most promising source of
prospective income, they don't seem to see it! But creditors always were
a purblind race.&mdash;<span class='smcap'>Would-Be Legislator.</span></p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p><span class='smcap'>Thank</span> you, Mrs. <span class='smcap'>Hungerford</span> (says the Baron, bowing his very best to the
talented authoress), for one of the cheeriest, freshest, and
sweetest&mdash;if I may be allowed to use the epithet&mdash;of one-volume'd
stories I've read for many a day. The three daughters are delightful. I
question whether you couldn't have done better with "two only, as are
generally necessary;" but perhaps this is ungrateful on my part. Anyway,
two out of the three lovers are scarcely worth mentioning, so I don't
think I am far wrong, for the team was a bit unmanageable, well as you
had them in hand. Excellent, too, is the sketch of <i>Dad</i>, though that of
<i>Aunt Jane</i> is a trifle too grotesque, and will, perforce, remind those
of your readers, who are theatre-goers, of Mr. <span class='smcap'>Penley</span> in petticoats, now
actually playing "<i>Charley's</i>" irresistibly comic <i>Aunt</i> at the Globe
Theatre. But it is all good, and not too good to be true. Likewise, my
dear Madame, you have given us two life-like sketches, one of a
car-driver with his vicious mare, and the other of <i>Molly's</i> little dog.
In conclusion, I congratulate you, Mrs. <span class='smcap'>Hungerford</span>, as also the
publisher, Mr. <span class='smcap'>Heinemann</span>, on having secured so good a specimen of the
material for sale in this Hungerford market, says</p>

<h2>PILL-DOCTOR HERDAL.</h2>

<p class='center'>(<i>Translated from the Original Norwegian by Mr. Punch.</i>)</p>

<p class='center'>SECOND ACT.</p>

<p><span class='smcap'>Dr. Herdal's</span> <i>Drawing-room and Dispensary, as before. It is early in the
day.</i> Dr. <span class='smcap'>Herdal</span> <i>sits by the little table, taking his own temperature
with a clinical thermometer. By the door stands the</i> New Book-keeper;
<i>he wears blue spectacles and a discoloured white tie, and seems
slightly nervous.</i></p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> Well, now you understand what is necessary. My late
book-keeper, Miss <span class='smcap'>Blakdraf</span>, used to keep my
accounts very cleverly&mdash;she charged every visit twice over.</p>

<p><i>The New B.</i> I am familiar with book-keeping by double entry. I
was once employed at a Bank.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> I am discharging my assistant, too; he was always trying to
push me out with his pills. Perhaps you will be able to dispense?</p>

<p><i>The New B.</i> (<i>modestly</i>). With an additional salary, I
should be able to do that too.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> Capital! You <i>shall</i> dispense with an
additional salary. Go into the Dispensary, and see what you can make of
it. You may mistake a few drugs at first&mdash;but everything must have
a beginning.</p>

<p class='outdent'>
[<i>As the</i> New B. <i>retires,</i>
Mrs. <span class='smcap'>Herdal</span> <i>enters in a hat</i>
<i>and cloak with a watering-pot, noiselessly.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Herd.</i> Miss <span class='smcap'>Wangel</span> got up
early, before breakfast, and went for a walk. She is so wonderfully
vivacious!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> So I should say. But tell
me, <span class='smcap'>Aline</span>, is she <em>really</em> going to stay
with us here?<span class='spacer5em'>&#8195;</span>[<i>Nervously.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Herd.</i> (<i>looks at him</i>). So she tells me. And, as she
has brought nothing with her except a tooth-brush and a powder-puff, I
am going into the town to get her a few articles. We <em>must</em> make
her feel at home.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>breaking out</i>). I <em>will</em> make her not
only <em>feel</em>, but <em>be</em> at home, wherever that is, this very
day! I will <em>not</em> have a perambulating Allegory without a

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>goes up straight to him</i>). Good morning,
Dr. <span class='smcap'>Herdal</span>. I have just seen a pig killed. It
was <em>ripping</em>&mdash;I mean, gloriously thrilling! And your wife has
taken a tremendous fancy to me. Fancy <em>that</em>!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>gloomily</i>). It <em>is</em> eccentric certainly.
But my poor dear wife was always a little&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>nods her head slowly several times</i>).
So <em>you</em> have noticed that too? I have had a long talk with her.
She can't get over your discharging
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Kalomel</span>&mdash;he is the only man who
ever <em>really</em> understood her.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> If I could only pay her off a little bit of the
huge, immeasurable debt I owe her&mdash;but I can't!</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>looks hard at him</i>). Can't <em>I</em> help you? I
helped <span class='smcap'>Ragnar Brovik</span>. Didn't you know I
stayed with him and poor
little <span class='smcap'>Kaia</span>&mdash;after that accident to my
Master Builder? I did. I made <span class='smcap'>Ragnar</span> build me
the loveliest castle in the air&mdash;lovelier, even, than poor Mr.
<span class='smcap'>Solness's</span> would have been&mdash;and we stood
together on the very top. The steps were rather too much
for <span class='smcap'>Kaia</span>. Besides, there was no room for her
on top. And he put towering spires on all his semi-detached villas.
Only, somehow, they didn't let. Then the castle in the air tumbled down,
and <span class='smcap'>Ragnar</span> went into liquidation, and I
continued my walking-tour.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>interested against his will</i>). And where did
you go after <i>that</i>, may I ask,
Miss <span class='smcap'>Wangel</span>?</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> Oh, ever so far North. There I met Mr. and
Mrs. <span class='smcap'>Tesman</span>&mdash;the second
Mrs. <span class='smcap'>Tesman</span>&mdash;she who was
Mrs. <span class='smcap'>Elvsted</span>, with the irritating hair, you
know. They were on their honeymoon, and had just decided that it was
impossible to reconstruct poor
Mr. <span class='smcap'>L&ouml;vborg's</span> great book out of Mrs.
<span class='smcap'>Elvsted's</span> rough notes. But I insisted
on <span class='smcap'>George's</span> attempting the
impossible&mdash;with Me. And what <i>do</i> you think
Mrs. <span class='smcap'>Tesman</span> wears in her hair <i>now</i>?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> Why, really I could not say. Vine-leaves, perhaps.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> Wrong&mdash;<em>straws!</em>
Poor <span class='smcap'>Tesman</span> <em>didn't</em> fancy that&mdash;so
he shot himself, <em>un</em>-beautifully, through his ticket-pocket. And I
went on and took Rosmersholm for the Summer. There had been misfortune
in the house, so it was to let. Dear good old
Rector <span class='smcap'>Kroll</span> acted as my reference; his wife
and children had no sympathy with his views, so I used to see him every
day. And I persuaded him, too, to attempt the impossible&mdash;he had
never ridden anything but a rocking-horse in his life, but I made him
promise to mount the White Horse of the Rosmersholms. He didn't get over
<em>that</em>. They found his body, a fortnight afterwards, in the
mill-dam. Thrilling!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>shakes his finger at her</i>). What a girl you
are, Miss <span class='smcap'>Wangel</span>! But you mustn't play these
games <em>here</em>, you know.</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>laughs to herself</i>). Of course not. But I suppose
I <em>am</em> a strange sort of bird.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> You are like a strong tonic. When I look at you I
seem to be regarding an effervescing saline draught. Still, I really
must decline to take you.</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>a little sulky</i>). That is not how you spoke ten
years ago, up at the mountain station, when you were such a flirt!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> <em>Was</em> I a flirt? Deuce take me if I remember.
But I am not like that <em>now</em>.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> Then you have really forgotten how you sat next to me
at the <i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i>, and made pills and swallowed them, and
were so splendid and buoyant and free that all the old women who knitted
left next day?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> What a memory you have for trifles,
Miss <span class='smcap'>Wangel</span>, it's quite wonderful!</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> Trifles! There was no trifling on <em>your</em> part.
When you promised to come back in ten years, like a troll, and fetch
me!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> Did I say all that? It <em>must</em> have
been <em>after</em> <i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i>!</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> It was. I was a mere chit then&mdash;only twenty-three;
but I remember. And now <em>I</em> have come for <em>you</em>.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> Dear, dear! But there is nothing of the troll about
me now I have married Mrs. <span class='smcap'>Solness</span>.</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>looking sharply at him</i>). Yes, I remember you
were always dropping in to tea in those days.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>seems hurt</i>). Every visit was duly put down
in the ledger and charged for&mdash;as poor
little <span class='smcap'>Senna</span> will tell you.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> Little <span class='smcap'>Senna</span>? Oh,
Dr. <span class='smcap'>Herdal</span>, I believe there is a bit of the
troll left in you still!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>laughs a little</i>). No, no; my conscience is
perfectly robust&mdash;always was.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> Are you quite <em>quite</em> sure that, when you went
indoors with dear Mrs. <span class='smcap'>Solness</span> that
afternoon, and left me alone with my Master Builder, you did not
foresee&mdash;perhaps wish&mdash;intend, even a little,
that&mdash;&mdash;H'm?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> That you would talk the poor man into clambering up
that tower? You want to drag <em>Me</em> into that business now!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg
125]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>teasingly</i>). Yes, I certainly think that then you
went on exactly like a troll.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>with uncontrollable emotion</i>).
<span class='smcap'>Hilda</span>, there is not a corner of me safe from
you! Yes, I see now that <em>must</em> have been the way of it. Then
I <em>was</em> a troll in that, too! But isn't it terrible the price I
have had to pay for it? To have a wife who&mdash;&mdash;. No, I shall
never roll a pill again&mdash;never, never!</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>lays her head on the stove, and answers as if half
asleep</i>). No more pills? Poor
Doctor <span class='smcap'>Herdal</span>!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>bitterly</i>). No&mdash;nothing but cosy
commonplace grey powders for a whole troop of children.</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>lively again</i>). Not <em>grey</em> powders!
(<i>Quite seriously.</i>) I will tell you what you shall make next.
Beautiful rainbow-coloured powders that will give one a real grip on the
world. Powders to make everyone free and buoyant, and ready to grasp at
one's own happiness, to <em>dare</em> what one <em>would</em>. I will have
you make them. I will&mdash;I <em>will!</em></p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> H'm! I am not quite sure that I clearly understand.
And then the ingredients&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> What stupid people all of you pill-doctors are, to be
sure! Why, they will be <em>poisons</em>, of course!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> Poisons? Why in the world should they
be <em>that</em>?</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>without answering him</i>). All the thrillingest,
deadliest poisons&mdash;it is only such things that are wholesome,
nowadays.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>as if caught by her enthusiasm</i>). And I could
colour them, too, by exposing them to rays cast through a prism. Oh,
<span class='smcap'>Hilda</span>, how I have needed you all these years!

<h2>THE ENGLISH-FRENCH EMBASSADORE AT THE MANSHUN HOUSE.</h2>

</div>

<p><span class='smcap'>Well</span>, we've bin a going on much as usual
at our grand old Manshun House under our trewly
liberal <span class='smcap'>Lord Mare</span>, but I ain't had nothink
werry new to tell about, till a few nites ago, when we had what I can
truthfully call a reel staggerer, and no mistake. It seems as it's
allers the custon, when a Embassadore, who has made hisself werry
poplar, is gitting jest a leetle tired of us, and begins to si for Ome
sweet Ome, for the principalest Gent in London to give him sitch a grand
Bankwet as he ain't never seen afore, and ain't never likely for to see
again. So the <span class='smcap'>Lord Mare</span>, hearing as the
French Embassadore was in that werry dellicate sitiwation, arsked about
three hundred of the most heminent Gents in all London to come to the
Manshun House to meet him, and they all came, as in course they wood do,
and that was one of the werry grandest Bankwets as regards silly brated
Gests as ewen I ewer had the honner of waiting on.</p>

<p>And now for the staggerers! Just to begin with, why the French
Embassadore is no more a Frenchman than I am! for his name it's
<span class='smcap'>Woddington</span>, and so was his Father's before
him, and strange to say, thanks, I spose, to the splendid dinner, <i>et
setterer</i>, as was guv him, he acshally told us as he rowed in the
Winning Boat at the Uniwersity Boat-race at Putney, ewer so many years
ago! Werry like a Frenchman, suttenly, or, as I should prefer saying,
werry like a Whale! Of course all the Gents present, being reel Gents,
looked quite as if they beleeved it all; but, when he afterwards went on
to say that his Grate Grandfather took his most religious and grayshus
Majesty, <span class='smcap'>King Charles the Second</span>, right up
into the Hoak Tree, and so saved his preshus life, I saw sum two or
three of the werry hiest on 'em trying in wain to look quite serious, as
if they bleeved it all; and one werry smart young feller near me said to
his friend, "Why not call it the Hoax Tree"? I didn't kno quite what he
meant, but they both had a quiet larf over it.</p>

</div>

<p>He gave us a few more staggerers, but not quite equal to the King
Charles one, and of course we coud all make allowances for him, as it
was his last chance in such a party as that was. But he made up for it
all before he left, by speaking of the Grand Old Copperation as one of
the werry noblest bodys in the world, and as having made its mark in the
history of this great Country, and how artily he hoped it would continue
and flurrish for ever! I don't suppose as there was any county
counsellers among so distingwisht a Body, or I should like to know what
they thort of the Embassadore's opinion of us! An I'm thinkin of wizitin
Parry myself and cummin out strong. And wy not? They tell me it will
make me kwite young again, for I shall go over there a helderly henglish
waiter and reappear in Parry as a "garsong" which is french for "a young
man."</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class='center'>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, March 6.</i>&mdash;"The <span class='smcap'>Speaker</span> took the Chair at
three o'clock." That is an extract from the <i>Journals of the House</i>, a
fascinating literary work, ably edited by Mr. <span class='smcap'>Palgrave</span> with the
assistance of Mr. <span class='smcap'>Milman</span>, much in favour at <span class='smcap'>Mudie's</span>. Last time I saw
<span class='smcap'>Speaker</span> rise from Chair was Banquet at
Mansion House given by way of farewell to <span class='smcap'>M.
Waddington</span>. Very remarkable scene it was. In ordinary
times <span class='smcap'>Speaker</span> of House of Commons is
personally unknown to outside public. He takes no part in debate; never
goes on Midlothian Campaigns; belongs to no faction; has no political
following; and should have no enemy. British public, regarding with
close attention the fascinating arena at Westminster, have evidently
formed clear opinion of its present President. When list of guests
whom <span class='smcap'>Lord Mayor</span> delighted to honour read out
by Toastmaster, name of <span class='smcap'>Speaker</span> received with
enthusiastic and prolonged applause. House of Commons men present, of
whom there was large muster, evidently taken by surprise. They know
the <span class='smcap'>Speaker</span>, because they daily live with
him. How outside public should have been seized with such keen
appreciation of his worth was more than they were prepared for.</p>

<p>This may have been, probably was, to some extent a <i>succ&egrave;s d'estime</i>.
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Peel's</span> speech was genuine triumph; very brief, the shortest of the
series, but incomparably the best; lofty in tone, perfect in delivery,
saying just the right thing at the right moment in the right way. Its
effect at Mansion House something like that which electrified House when
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Peel</span>, standing on steps of Chair, faced it for first time as its
<span class='smcap'>Speaker</span>, revealing, even to those who had
known him long, the full depths of his nature and the towering height of
his capacity.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>, <span class='smcap'>Tobee</span>," said an eminent
Frenchman, "the world in both hemispheres has always envied you the
possession of your House of Commons. Now we know you have a Speaker
worthy of its best traditions."</p>

<p>Banquet a great success; certainly the most brilliant galaxy of
guests drawn together in same place since
Mr. <span class='smcap'>Phelps</span>, the American Minister, said
farewell in memorable speech. Much struck with completeness of
arrangements. Even the waiters imbued with consciousness of great
occasion.</p>

<p>"Hope you enjide your dinner, Sir?" said one to me, when dessert
placed on table.</p>

<p>"Excellent," I said; "perhaps the whitebait done a little too much;
showed tendency to present itself in fragments; but 'twas nothing."</p>

<p>"Yessir," said the Waiter, diligently brushing off imaginary crumbs.
"I'm going now, Sir."</p>

<p>"Ah," I said; "then I suppose you don't wait to hear the speeches;
flow of reason, you know, quite a treat."</p>

<p>"Yessir," said he, still pegging away at the spotless table-cloth.
"Can I get you anything more, Sir?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," I said, quite touched at the man's considerate
attention, the more marked since, as far as I recognised him, I had not
seen him before. "I've done excellently."</p>

<p>"Yessir. I'm going now." Hardly seemed able to part. Not sure
whether, in circumstances of international amity, I shouldn't have
shaken hands with him. Made half advance in that direction. He quickly
advanced his hand, but after glance at my extended palm, as rapidly
withdrew it. Perhaps he was right. Not usual to shake hands with Waiter,
though really, on occasion like this, one might disregard
conventionalities. Waiter lingeringly withdrew, still keeping his eye on
me, as if expecting me to call him back. Nodded a friendly farewell, and
pensively peeled an orange, thinking how one touch of nature makes us
kin. This good Waiter and I quite subdued by the graceful, generous
thought of Lord Mayor <span class='smcap'>Knill</span>, who has added
one more link to the chain that binds in amity two nations that have
fought all the way from Cressy to Waterloo.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Got into Committee on Navy Estimates. In
the Lobby sort of rehearsal of new Battle of Boyne. The other
night <span class='smcap'>Saunderson</span> said something disrespectful
of Irish Members. <span class='smcap'>Willie Redmond</span>, from his
proud position among nobility and gentry above Gangway, called out, "You
wouldn't say that in the Lobby." "Say it anywhere," responded the
Colonel, ever ready to oblige.</p>

<p>Next day wrote letter to <span class='smcap'>Redmond</span>, incidentally mentioning that if he
wanted to hear the words over again, should meet him in Lobby to-night
after questions. Nothing nearer <span class='smcap'>Redmond's</span> heart's desire. At five
o'clock Colonel, accompanied by another military gentleman, carrying his
cloak, a pair of pistols, a stiletto, a bottle of <i>eau de Cologne</i>, a
sponge, and a clothes-brush, sternly strode into Lobby. Carefully
counted paces till he was standing as nearly as possible on centre tile;
folded arms, and wished that Night or <span class='smcap'>Redmond</span> would come. Colonel
<span class='smcap'>Waring</span>, with military accoutrements and cloak; stood a pace and a half
to the left rear. Presently entered <span class='smcap'>Redmond</span>, accompanied by J. J.
<span class='smcap'>O'kelly</span>, also carrying cloak. Secreted in
folds were shillelagh, bottle of whiskey, pair of spurs, a toothpick,
and a freshly-minted crown-piece. This last, at suitable moment, to be
flung across Lobby; (friend secretly told off to be on alert to pick it
up.) Action to be explained as typical of throwing King's Crown into the
Boyne. The principals approaching, <span class='smcap'>Redmond</span>,
after manner of schoolboys, who edge up to each other, each hoping the
other doesn't want to fight, asked Colonel to "say it again."
"Certainly; but say what?" Here difficulty began, which spoiled whole
business. <span class='smcap'>Redmond</span> insisted upon being called
a murderer. <span class='smcap'>Saunderson</span> punctilious on minor
points, wouldn't go quite so far in his desire to oblige. Angry
altercation followed; Members, to number of something like hundred,
formed ring. <span class='smcap'>Redmond</span>, with right shoulder
aggressively hoisted, spoke over it at the Colonel. Colonel stood erect,
with hands loosely hanging by his side, ready for emergencies. Crowd
grew thicker and more excited. "Expected every moment would be our
next," as <span class='smcap'>Clancy</span> breathlessly put it. But in
the end storm blew itself out. Nothing happened, and crowd
disappointedly dispersed.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ulster will fight,<br />
But&mdash;&mdash;<em>not to-night.</em></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Opposition mustered to-day in high spirits;
meeting at Carlton yesterday addressed
by <span class='smcap'>Markiss</span> and
Prince <span class='smcap'>Arthur; Grandolph,</span> looking in, took
back seat in his customary retiring fashion. Meeting insisted on his
coming to the front; made spirited speech; scarcely a dry eye in the
Club when, looking shyly across at
Prince <span class='smcap'>Arthur</span>, he alluded to him as his "old
political friend," his "brilliant and esteemed Parliamentary
Leader."</p>

<p>"I think," said the <span class='smcap'>Markiss</span>, as meeting dispersed, "this will drive nail
in coffin of Home-Rule Bill, and make things pretty hot for Mr. G. As
<span class='smcap'>Hart Dyke</span> epigrammatically puts it, 'We
Unionists, above all others, should be united.'"</p>

<p>This, as I mentioned, happened yesterday. This afternoon Opposition
mustered in anticipation of aggressive action by Mr. G. Had given notice
to move suspension of Twelve o'Clock Rule, in order to make progress
with Estimates.</p>

<p>"Not if we know it," said Right Hon. <span class='smcap'>James
Lowther</span>, commonly called <span class='smcap'>"Jemmie."</span></p>

<p>Mr. G., previous to moving Resolution, explained there was no intention
of sitting late; Suspension Standing Order was matter of precaution
designed to prevent arbitrary carrying over of Amendments when
adequately discussed. Prince <span class='smcap'>Arthur's</span> keen eye discerned that this might
be so construed as to convey no advantage to Government. When twelve
o'clock came Debate might be diverged on to lines of wrangle round
Question of Adjournment, and so House up and nothing done. On this
understanding he declared he would not resist Motion of Leader of House.
Then <span class='smcap'>Jemmie</span>, rushing to the front, made the running. Did Mr. G. intend,
in any case, to take Second Reading of Home-Rule Bill on Thursday next?
Mr. G. nodded assent. "Very well, then I'll divide against you," <span class='smcap'>Jemmie</span>
roared across the pained figure of his esteemed Leader. Not to be moved
by blandishment or argument from this position. Prince <span class='smcap'>Arthur</span>, seeing
matters hopeless, haughtily strode forth, <span class='smcap'>Grandolph</span> loyally accompanying
him. But more than half his old colleagues stayed behind with <span class='smcap'>Jemmie
Lowther</span> who got Opposition soundly beaten by majority of 85.</p>

<p>"There's only one thing we want to run our majority over 100," said
<span class='smcap'>Squire of Malwood</span>, smiling beneficently from
Treasury Bench. "Another meeting of the Party at the Carlton Club will
do it."</p>

<p>"What did you mean by to-night's performance?" I
asked <span class='smcap'>Jemmie</span>, later.</p>

<p>"Mean? I meant business. I'm a little tired of lurking in background
seeing men come to front who haven't half my ability, political acumen,
or Parliamentary knowledge. I intend to have a Party of my own. There
has been a Fourth Party, and before that there was a Tea-room Party, and
a Cave of Adullam. I shall eclipse them all."</p>

<p>"And under what name do you think history will know your faction?" I
asked, much interested.</p>

<p>The Right Hon. took up a piece of paper, and on it wrote the words,
<span class='smcap'>"Lowther's Arcade."</span></p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class='smcap'>Wolmer's</span>
Amendment on the Navy Estimates negatived.</p>

Statesman to whom <span class='smcap'>Austen Chamberlain</span>
distantly alludes as "My Right Hon. friend," sit separated by width of
House. But, in assaults on Government, they are not divided. Idle
stories about differences of opinion arising between them quite
unnecessarily denied.</p>

<p>"I never look at them," said <span class='smcap'>Trevelyan</span>, "without recalling to mind a
passage in what is, I think, my favourite among <span class='smcap'>Dickens's</span> novels. You
remember the scene in <i>Great Expectations</i>, where <i>Joe Gargery</i> visits
<i>Pip</i>, in his day of prosperity, in London? 'Ever best of friends,' says

<span class='smcap'>Joe</span>, 'as you and me were ever friends, and it
were looked forrerd to betwixt us as bein' calc'lated to lead to

gallon flask of <i>Vinum Purum Italianum</i>, such as Chianti, and he would
be none the worse for it. We are inclined to agree with the Signor
<span class='smcap'>Vitali</span>, as, in our opinion, there is small likelihood of any Italian
wine-drinker "getting any forrader." Of course Signor <span class='smcap'>Vitali</span>, being
somewhat interested in the matter, and therefore, most hopeful that his
enterprise will result in orders for any number of flasks, and not end
in an empty <i>fiasco</i>, would not fail to point out that Italian wine is
likely to have a prolonged existence in this country, as it is not
lacking in Vitali-ty.</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
